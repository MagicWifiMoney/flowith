## Today's Highlights: June 1, 2025

Welcome to your daily briefing on the latest in the credit card world. Today, we cover new regulations impacting card fees and rewards, heightened CFPB scrutiny on reward programs in the US, a roundup of top-tier bonus offers that continue into June, and actionable consumer advice.

### üî• Top Stories: Regulatory Landscape & CFPB Actions

*   **New Credit Card Regulations Effective June 1:** Globally, new rules are taking effect concerning credit card payment fees, reward structures, and penalty charges. For instance, some international banks (e.g., Kotak Mahindra Bank in India) are implementing fees on specific transactions like fuel payments above a certain threshold and further capping reward points on categories like rent, utilities, and insurance. Auto-debit failure penalties are also seeing adjustments. While specifics vary by region and issuer, this signals a broader trend. Cardholders are advised to check with their respective banks for any changes to their terms.

*   **CFPB Intensifies Scrutiny on Misleading US Credit Card Rewards:** The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the U.S. is cracking down on "bait-and-switch" tactics by credit card issuers. The agency has issued warnings about practices such as illegal devaluation of rewards, implementing undisclosed conditions, and failing to deliver promised benefits. The CFPB continues to monitor and enforce fair standards for rewards programs.

*   **Controversy Over US Credit Card Late Fee Cap Reversal:** Earlier reports highlighted the Trump administration's reversal of rules capping credit card late fees, a move promoted by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While DOGE claimed this would save Americans $9.5 billion annually, independent government analyses and financial experts suggest the opposite, estimating an increase in costs for consumers by approximately $10 billion per year.
