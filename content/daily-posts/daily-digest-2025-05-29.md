**1. Digital Experience Plateau in Banking & Credit Cards, J.D. Power Finds**

A new study by J.D. Power, released May 29, 2025, indicates that while overall customer satisfaction with bank and credit card digital platforms has improved, these platforms are struggling to differentiate themselves. Key findings include:
*   **Homogenous Offerings:** Many institutions have refined their digital properties around industry best practices, leading to similar user experiences.
*   **Satisfaction Leaders:** American Express ranked highest in credit card mobile app and online satisfaction. Bank of America led among national banks for mobile app satisfaction, and Capital One for online banking satisfaction.
*   **Key Drivers:** Multifactor authentication is increasingly tied to higher customer satisfaction.
*   **AI Opportunity:** Virtual assistants are currently underutilized, presenting an opportunity for more advanced AI integration.

**2. Capital One Spark Annual Fee Policy Changes Stir Online Communities**

Discussions on forums like Reddit's r/creditcards highlight user concerns regarding Capital One's Spark business cards. Reports suggest Capital One is becoming stricter with waiving the $59 annual fee, even for customers with significant spending. This has led some to question the card's value proposition compared to emerging no-annual-fee 2% cash-back business cards. Users are reportedly exploring alternatives like the Fidelity 2% card, Amex Bread, and Wells Fargo Signify.
