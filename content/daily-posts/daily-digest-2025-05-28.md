## Today's Credit Card Landscape: May 28, 2025

Welcome to your Daily Credit Card Digest! We're tracking the latest offers, news, and trends to keep you ahead in the world of credit card rewards and personal finance.


The credit card market has seen a period of adjustment following recent major promotions, with no significant new product launches announced by top outlets in the last 24 hours. However, key discussions and ongoing developments continue to shape the landscape:

*   **Citi Strata Card Discussion:** While launched a few days prior, the Citi Strata Card remains a noteworthy recent entry. It features a $0 annual fee and offers up to 5X points on select spending categories, presenting a compelling option for those seeking no-annual-fee rewards.
*   **Credit Card Competition Act:** Legislative watchers are monitoring the Credit Card Competition Act, which may soon face a floor vote in Congress, potentially as an amendment to a stablecoin bill. If passed, this act could significantly alter interchange fee structures and, consequently, reshape credit card rewards programs across the industry.
*   **General Market Sentiment:** Top financial news sources indicate a relatively quiet period for brand-new major card announcements or significant bonus shifts in the immediate past day. This may suggest a market stabilization phase after earlier spring promotional activities.


Several attractive bonus offers are currently active, providing excellent opportunities for new applicants. Here are some highlights based on recent reports:

*   **Chase Marriott Bonvoy Boundless® Credit Card:**
    *   **Offer:** Earn 3 Free Night Awards (each valued up to 50,000 points) after spending $3,000 in the first 3 months. Plus, earn an additional 50,000 bonus points after spending a total of $6,000 in the first 6 months.
    *   **Note:** This is a strong offer for Marriott loyalists.

*   **Chase Airline Co-Branded Cards (United):**
    *   **United Explorer℠ Card:** Reported offer of 60,000 bonus miles.
    *   **United Quest℠ Card:** Reported offer of 70,000 bonus miles + 500 Premier Qualifying Points (PQP).
    *   **United Club℠ Infinite Card:** Reported offer of 90,000 bonus miles.
    *   **United Gateway℠ Card:** Reported offer of 30,000 bonus miles, $0 annual fee, and 0% intro APR for 12 months on purchases.

    *   **British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Iberia Visa Signature® Cards:** Reports indicate an offer of 85,000 Avios after a $5,000 spend in 3 months. Separately, one source mentions a Chase British Airways Visa Signature Card offer for 100,000 Avios after $7,500 spend in 6 months. *Please verify the current best offer directly.*

    *   **Offer:** Reported offer of 150,000 Membership Rewards® points after spending $8,000 in the first 6 months.

Stay informed on recent changes and discussions impacting cardholders:

*   **Enhanced Benefits for U.S. Military Personnel (SCRA & MLA):**
    *   Active-duty U.S. military members continue to benefit from significant financial protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and Military Lending Act (MLA).
    *   These acts can provide interest rate caps (e.g., 6% under SCRA on pre-service debt) and encourage issuers to waive certain fees.
    *   Many card issuers, such as **Capital One** (often applies a 4% interest rate cap and waives annual/other fees) and **Chase** (typically waives all personal card fees and may apply a 4% APR on eligible pre-service balances), provide substantial value. This allows access to premium card perks like travel credits and airport lounge access, often without the annual fee burden for eligible servicemembers and sometimes their dependents.

*   **Upcoming Credit Reporting Changes (Effective Jan 2025):**
    *   Reports indicate that starting January 2025, banks are expected to begin reporting individual credit card activity more granularly to Credit Information Companies (CICs).
    *   This change could influence how credit profiles are assessed and potentially alter credit scoring models. Cardholders, especially those who frequently open new accounts or manage multiple cards, should be aware of this development.

*   **Community Report: Potential Chase Ink Cash® Card Category Changes:**
    *   **Source:** Discussions within online credit card communities (e.g., Reddit r/CreditCards).
    *   **Reported Change:** Some users have reported receiving communications from Chase suggesting changes to the Chase Ink Cash® Card's rewards structure. The traditional 5x bonus categories (on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on internet, cable and phone services each account anniversary year) are reportedly being replaced by 3x points on gas, restaurants, office supply stores, and home improvement stores, with a $2,000 per month spending cap on these 3x categories, and 1x on all other purchases.
    *   **Status:** This information is currently based on community reports and should be verified directly with Chase or through official communications. If broadly confirmed, this would represent a significant shift in the card's earning structure for new and potentially existing cardholders.

*   **Citi Rewards+® Card No Longer Accepting New Applications:**
    *   It has been reported that Citi has stopped accepting new applications for the Citi Rewards+® Card. This could impact strategies for individuals aiming to maximize Citi ThankYou® Points.
